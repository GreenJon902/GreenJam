# GreenJam
Very early WIP  
Effectively a programming language but every thing is configurable, you will be able to add completely new syntax structures and change how it compiles and into what (e.g. machine code, assembly, or perhaps a different language like c, or something
altogether different like yml to json conversion)

The rules will also be converted to the proper syntax rules eventually. |
