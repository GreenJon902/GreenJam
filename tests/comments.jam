// This file has just comments! There should be absolutely
// no token output and therefor nothing should get parsed!

// Comments can be on only one line and be prefixed by two
// slashes like this: // . But if you want to have multiple
// line comments, or a comment with code after on the same
// line (Idk why anyone would want to do that but ya can!)
// then you need to use block comments which look like this:

/** I am a block comment! */
/** I can be
    on multiple lines. */
/**
 * But if you do that then I prefer
 * to be formatted like this as it
 * looks much nicer.
 */
